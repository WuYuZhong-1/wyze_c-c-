Let us sacrifice our today so that our children can have a better tomorrow
Good judgment comes from experience, and a lot of that comes from bad judgment. 
No act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted.
The best preparation for tomorrow is doing your best today.
Change your life today. Don't gamble on the future, act now, without delay
Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn
The secret of getting ahead is getting started.
Wise men speak because they have something to say; Fools because they have to say something
All our dreams can come true, if we have the courage to pursue them
You don't choose your family. They are God's gift to you, as you are to them.
Life isn't about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself.
Everything has beauty, but not everyone sees it.
Do not dwell in the past, do not dream of the future, concentrate the mind on the present moment.
Nothing is impossible, the word itself says 'I'm possible'!
Try to be a rainbow in someone's cloud.
To be really happy and really safe, one ought to have at least two or three hobbies, and they must all be real. 
It is no use starting late in life to say: “I will take an interest in this or that.” Such an attempt only aggravates the strain of mental effort.
 A man may acquire great knowledge of topics unconnected with his daily work, and yet hardly get any benefit or relief. It is no use doing what you like; 
 you have got to like what you do. Broadly speaking, human beings may be divided into three classes: those who are toiled to death, 
 those who are worried to death, and those who are bored to death. It is no use offering the manual labourer, tired out with a hard week’s sweat and effort, 
 the chance of playing a game of football or baseball on Saturday afternoon. It is no use inviting the politician or the professional or business man, 
 who has been working or worrying about serious things for six days, to work or worry about trifling things at the weekend.
　　
　　It may also be said that rational, industrious useful human beings are divided into two classes: 
first, those whose work is work and whose pleasure is pleasure; and secondly, those whose work and pleasure are one.
 Of these the former are the majority. They have their compensations. 
The long hours in the office or the factory bring with them as their reward, not only the means of sustenance, 
but a keen appetite for pleasure even in its simplest and most modest forms. But Fortune’s favoured children belong to the second class. 
Their life is a natural harmony. For them the working hours are never long enough. Each day is a holiday, and ordinary holidays when they 
come are grudged as enforced interruptions in an absorbing vocation. Yet to both classes the need of an alternative outlook, of a change of atmosphere, 
of a diversion of effort, is essential. Indeed, it may well be that those whose work is their pleasure are those who most need the means of banishing it at intervals from their minds.

To be really happy and really safe, one ought to have at least two or three hobbies, and they must all be real. 
It is no use starting late in life to say: “I will take an interest in this or that.” Such an attempt only aggravates the strain of mental effort.
 A man may acquire great knowledge of topics unconnected with his daily work, and yet hardly get any benefit or relief. It is no use doing what you like; 
 you have got to like what you do. Broadly speaking, human beings may be divided into three classes: those who are toiled to death, 
 those who are worried to death, and those who are bored to death. It is no use offering the manual labourer, tired out with a hard week’s sweat and effort, 
 the chance of playing a game of football or baseball on Saturday afternoon. It is no use inviting the politician or the professional or business man, 
 who has been working or worrying about serious things for six days, to work or worry about trifling things at the weekend.
　　
　　It may also be said that rational, industrious useful human beings are divided into two classes: 
first, those whose work is work and whose pleasure is pleasure; and secondly, those whose work and pleasure are one.
 Of these the former are the majority. They have their compensations. 
The long hours in the office or the factory bring with them as their reward, not only the means of sustenance, 
but a keen appetite for pleasure even in its simplest and most modest forms. But Fortune’s favoured children belong to the second class. 
Their life is a natural harmony. For them the working hours are never long enough. Each day is a holiday, and ordinary holidays when they 
come are grudged as enforced interruptions in an absorbing vocation. Yet to both classes the need of an alternative outlook, of a change of atmosphere, 
of a diversion of effort, is essential. Indeed, it may well be that those whose work is their pleasure are those who most need the means of banishing it at intervals from their minds.

Let us sacrifice our today so that our children can have a better tomorrow
Good judgment comes from experience, and a lot of that comes from bad judgment. 
No act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted.
The best preparation for tomorrow is doing your best today.
Change your life today. Don't gamble on the future, act now, without delay
Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn
The secret of getting ahead is getting started.
Wise men speak because they have something to say; Fools because they have to say something
All our dreams can come true, if we have the courage to pursue them
You don't choose your family. They are God's gift to you, as you are to them.
Life isn't about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself.
Everything has beauty, but not everyone sees it.
Do not dwell in the past, do not dream of the future, concentrate the mind on the present moment.
Nothing is impossible, the word itself says 'I'm possible'!
Try to be a rainbow in someone's cloud.
